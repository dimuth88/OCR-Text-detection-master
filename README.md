# OCR Algorithm for MSc in Information Technology

* Introduction

This Python script implements an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithm developed as part of a Master's dissertation in Information Technology. The algorithm was designed to accurately extract text from images.

* Testing and Results

The algorithm was thoroughly tested on a diverse dataset of 61 images. Out of these, 57 images were successfully processed, demonstrating a high accuracy rate.
